# What Ablago can handle {#was-ablago-verkraftet}

Measured with the [load test](lasttest.md) in three levels: **small** (household, 25 simultaneous requests, 5,000 Mappen), **medium** (small business, 100 simultaneous with an export running alongside, 50,000 Mappen) and **large** (increasing the load up to the limit, 200,000 Mappen). The columns show p95 – 95 % of the answers were faster – and for large the limit in simultaneous requests at which 95 % of the answers still stayed below 3 s.

Since #739, every level additionally measures **with saving** (same load, about 10 % writing requests), and there is the level **extreme** (like large, with 500,000 or 1 million Mappen). The previous columns measure exactly as before and remain comparable with the older rows; the new values are in a separate table below. Older measurements have no row there.

The rows "GitHub machine" are measured by the project every week on GitHub's machines (workflow *Lasttest*); there Ablago, PostgreSQL and the load test run on the same machine. The other rows are reports from operators – collected in the issue [Load test results (#576)](https://github.com/motom001/dms/issues/576) and in [separate reports](https://github.com/motom001/dms/issues?q=label%3Amessergebnis-lasttest), each with version and date, because new versions can be faster or slower.

On which devices the project tests Ablago itself – and until when it expects to – is shown in the installation manual under [Tested platforms](https://help.ablago.app/installieren/aktuell/plattformen/).

**With saving and extreme** – p95 of the runs "+ saving", in brackets p95 of the writing requests only; for extreme the limit, the duration of creating the demo data and the size of the database:

You have measured yourself? [Running a load test yourself](lasttest.md) describes how. You add the result block as a comment to the collective issue [Load test results (#576)](https://github.com/motom001/dms/issues/576) – or you create a separate issue with the template [Load test result](https://github.com/motom001/dms/issues/new?template=messergebnis-lasttest.yml). The project enters the reports here.

**How much memory?** What matters for choosing the device is what the **whole container** needs – in the result the row *Arbeitsspeicher Container höchstens* (container memory at most), not just *Ablago höchstens*. On the project's NAS (UGREEN DXP4800 Plus, `dms-komplett`, 200,000 Mappen), Ablago itself needed at most about 1 GB, the Docker interface showed just under 2 GB for the container. As a rule of thumb: for a household, a device with **2 GB** free for the container is enough; for a small business or very many Mappen, plan **4 GB**. Part of it is file cache that the system gives back when needed.

**How to read the table:** if *small* is below 0.3 s, Ablago feels smooth for a household. If *medium* is below 1 s, the device is also enough for a small business with large exports alongside. These values are the project's **target**. The *limit* of large is no target for everyday use – 100 simultaneous requests are already 10–15 people clicking at the same moment (see [Technology → Many simultaneous requests](technik.md#last)).

**Target and CI limit:** for *small* and *medium*, the weekly measurement on GitHub's machines turns red if it misses the **CI limit**. The CI limit came from the first run there plus 20 % and only gets stricter, at most down to the target. Since speeding up (#615), *medium* also meets the target (586 ms on GitHub's machines, 423 ms on the maintainer's NAS); so the CI limit is now **equal to the target**: 0.3 s for *small*, 1 s for *medium*. Measurements from other devices help further – report them in the collective issue [Load test results (#576)](https://github.com/motom001/dms/issues/576).
